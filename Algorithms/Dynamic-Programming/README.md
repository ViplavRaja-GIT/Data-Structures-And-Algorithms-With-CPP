# Dynamic Programming
>Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map, etc.). So the next time the same sub-problem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time.

    The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the largest possible sum of a contiguous subarray, within a given one-dimensional array A[1…n] of numbers.
