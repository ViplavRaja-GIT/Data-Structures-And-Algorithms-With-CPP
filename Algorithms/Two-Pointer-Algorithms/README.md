- [**3Sum**](/Algorithms/Two-Pointer-Algorithms/3Sum.cpp)
Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given 0. If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet.
- [**Floyd's-Cycle-Finding**](/Algorithms/Two-Pointer-Algorithms/Floyd's-Cycle-Finding.cpp)
Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds. It states the usage of Linked List in this algorithm and its output.The purpose is to determine whether the linked list has a cycle or not.
